I developed a dynamic and interactive web application called "Dice Game" using React.js. This project demonstrates my proficiency in front-end web development and my ability to create an engaging user experience. The game is designed with a simple set of rules:

    - Number Selection: Players can select any number they think will be rolled on the dice.

    - Dice Roll: By clicking on the dice image, the game randomly generates a number representing the roll of the dice.

    - Scoring: If the selected number matches the rolled number, the player is rewarded with a point equal to the dice value. However, if the guess is incorrect, the player incurs a penalty of 2 points.

Key Accomplishments:

    - React.js Proficiency: I leveraged the power of React.js to create an interactive and responsive user interface. React's component-based architecture allowed for the efficient management of the game's state and user interactions.

    - Random Number Generation: I implemented a random number generator to simulate the dice roll, ensuring a fair and unpredictable gaming experience.

    - Scoring System: The project includes a robust scoring system that dynamically updates the player's score based on correct and incorrect guesses.

    - User Experience: I focused on delivering an enjoyable user experience by incorporating engaging visuals and smooth animations.

    - Learning Experience: Through this project, I honed my problem-solving skills and deepened my understanding of front-end development, reinforcing my commitment to delivering high-quality applications.
